This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs data analysis and machine learning on a runner's metrics, such as step frequency, heart rate, distance, and height. The code processes a CSV file of runner's track data, and performs the following tasks:

**Task 1:** Calculate the step frequency per minute, and report the average of these values.

**Task 2:** Perform K-means clustering on the height and heart rate data, and visualize the results with a scatter plot.

The repository also contains the original CSV file used in the analysis.

**Please note that:**

- These tasks were orginally developed as a part of a take home assignment for an internship role at Optomatica.

- This code was developed using ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, and was used as an example to demonstrate ChatGPT's ability to aid in data analysis and machine learning tasks.

- This README.md was generated by ChatGPT with minor edits.
